# ICT606A2 COVID-19 Tweets NLP Topic Modelling (Python)

Social media is a powerful tool for understanding public sentiment, especially during times of crisis. In this project, we use the natural language processing (NLP) algorithm BERTopic to examine COVID-19 tweets and identify the topics that are being discussed and the overall sentiment of the tweets.

BERTopic is a state-of-the-art topic modeling algorithm that is based on the BERT language model. It is particularly well-suited for topic modeling of social media data, as it is able to capture the nuances of language and context that are often present in tweets. By using BERTopic to examine COVID-19 tweets, we can gain valuable insights into the public's perceptions and concerns about the pandemic.

Data cleaning and preparation:
- Text cleaning: Remove punctuation, stop words, and other irrelevant information.
- Lemmatization: Convert all words to their root form.
- Formatting: Ensure that all text is in a consistent format.

Bag of Words (BOW) and TF-IDF word cloud:
- Bag of Words: Create a representation of the text data by counting the number of occurrences of each word.
- Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF): Calculate a measure of the importance of each word in the text data.
- Word cloud: Generate a visualization of the most important words in the text data.

Sentiment analysis:
- Identify the overall sentiment of the text data (positive, negative, or neutral).

Topic Modeling (BERTopic Modelling):
- Identify the different topics that are present in the text data.
- Group the text data into clusters based on the topics.
